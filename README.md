# Bean-Fps
This is an fps game where you play as beans with abilities to track down the target

one bean will be the hiding bean, while 4 other beans trace down the target. The taget can turn into other objects around the map, and the other 4 beans have special abilities based on the character they select

Much of the "cooler" code and features are in assets -> scripts

there will also be an online feature. to the game which is being handled in the "server folder"

This project is still in development. Working title: Where Have You Bean
